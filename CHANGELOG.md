## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Character-conformance engine (`aozora-proof-core`): JIS X 0208 水準
  classification, 機種依存文字 detection, half-width katakana, and
  file-structure checks (BOM, line endings, encoding) — merged with the
  `aozora` parser's notation diagnostics into one sorted report, with a JSON
  wire format that is a superset of the parser's diagnostic shape.
- `aozora-proof-data`: a `char → JIS 水準` classifier and 機種依存文字
  predicate, baked at build time from the Project X0213 mapping table.
- `aozora-proof` CLI: `check` with human / JSON / short / **SARIF** output, stdin
  and multi-file input, `--strict` / `--fail-on`, and a 0 / 1 / 2 / 3 exit-code
  contract for CI.
- **Old-/new-form (旧字体↔新字体) detection** (`aozora-proof-data` + the `kyuji`
  layer): flags 旧字体 / 異体字 characters that have a 新字体 counterpart (derived
  from the 常用漢字表) and suggests the modern form; `check --diff` / `--fix`
  preview or apply the replacements.
- **Gaiji (外字) lookup** (`aozora-proof-data` + the `gaiji_dict` module + the
  `aozora-proof gaiji` subcommand): character ⇔ JIS 面区点 ⇔ Unicode and
  description search over the CC0 外字注記辞書, with a suggested 外字注記 form.
- A composite **GitHub Action** (`action/`) that runs the checks and uploads
  SARIF to the Security tab, and a **pre-commit** hook (`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`)
  for downstream `.txt` repositories.
